I have experience building websites for clients using Node.js and WordPress. You can see those in the [Work](work) section.

I like to experiment with different aspects of web design. You are welcome to take look at those on the [Projects](projects) page.

For eight years I have provided web and graphic design as [Sediment Press](https://sedimentpress.com), a company I founded in Washington, DC. More on my skills and experience can be found on the [Resume](resume) page.

I am currently looking for a full time web design position at a software company in New Orleans. If you would like to talk I can be reached at <a href='&#109;ailt&#111;&#58;&#99;on&#116;&#97;c&#37;74&#64;%63&#37;68&#97;&#114;%6C%65&#37;&#55;3rob&#101;rt&#115;on%2Eio'>conta&#99;t&#64;c&#104;&#97;r&#108;esrob&#101;rt&#115;on&#46;io</a>.
