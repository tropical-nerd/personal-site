My first from-scratch WordPress theme and possibly my finest work, Dactyl Nightmare is a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure type game that really only gives you one choice&mdash; Pterodactyl. I created it as quick way to run through the theme creation and deployment process, and as an exercise in fundamental responsive design.
