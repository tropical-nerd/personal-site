Raven needed a site that would showcase their innovativeness in the event design industry. They had a website on Squarespace but it was proving too rigid to fit their content as their company grew. They provided Photoshop comps for a desktop version. From those I designed mobile comps and then a fully responsive, mobile-first theme.

Raven has a large portfolio that is a major focus of the site. I put the bulk of the interactivity budget there, adding tag filtering using the Isotope library by David DeSandro. To improve performance I used srcsets, lazy-loading and CloudFlare site caching.

Another fun interactive UI element of the site is the polyhedron overlays on the Crew page. The crew is represented as a grid of polyhedrons until you hover or tap (on mobile) and the crew member is revealed. It's a small touch that reveals the personality of the team and adds a lot of character to the site.
