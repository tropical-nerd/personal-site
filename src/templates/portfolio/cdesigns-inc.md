CDesigns, Inc. provides high end renovations and wanted a website to reflect the sophistication of their work. After completing the visual design I was able to find an existing WordPress theme that had the right structure and built a child theme to suit. The result was an attractive site that was inexpensive and easy to maintain.

For the gallery I used the default WordPress gallery and added [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com) as a light box to improve the user interface especially on mobile.
